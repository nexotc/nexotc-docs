# How Institutions Use NexOTC

!!! note "Private, Compliant and Scalable OTC for Institutions"
    NexOTC gives institutional players a secure and adaptable OTC experience, ideal for funds, family offices, brokers and enterprise trading desks. The platform supports high-volume deals, custom trade logic and audit-ready compliance without ever compromising privacy or control.

## Institutional OTC Workflow

1. **KYC/KYB via Zero-Knowledge Identity**

    - Your organization completes verification using PrivadoID;
    - No personal data is exposed. Only cryptographic proof is stored and used.

2. **Set Trade Parameters**

    - Configure asset type, trade size, price terms, tranche structure and timeline;
    - Optionally define commission logic and add introducer wallets.

3. **Match or Invite Counterparties**

    - Use AI Matchmaking Agents or a private invite link;
    - Negotiation is supported until terms are finalized and signed.

4. **Smart Contract Escrow Deployment**

    - Multi-sig or proxy wallets can be used for secure participation;
    - All trade rules including milestones, tranche logic or deadlines are encoded into the escrow contract.

5. **Trade Execution & Settlement**

    - Funds are released as each condition is met;
    - Commissions are routed automatically;
    - A full zk-proof of compliance is generated for reporting and audit purposes.
