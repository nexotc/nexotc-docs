# Post-Trade Compliance & Reporting

!!! info "Generate Proofs Without Exposing Data"
    After every OTC trade, NexOTC automatically produces **compliance-ready artifacts** using zero-knowledge proofs, selective disclosures, and audit-friendly logs — without revealing sensitive trade data.

<h2>🧾 Zero-Knowledge Compliance Logs</h2>

Each trade generates a ZK-SNARK proof that confirms:
- ✅ KYC/KYB was performed
- ✅ Assets matched approved lists
- ✅ AML thresholds were respected
- ✅ Terms and conditions were digitally signed
- ✅ All commissions were routed properly

> 🔐 These logs prove **compliance** without disclosing counterparties, asset size, or wallet addresses.
