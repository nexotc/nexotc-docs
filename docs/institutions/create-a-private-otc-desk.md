## What Is a Private Desk?

A **Private OTC Desk** is a permissioned trading space inside NexOTC where:

- You define who can access and participate;
- You customize deal templates and terms;
- Commissions and fees are routed automatically;
- You can limit assets, regions or counterparties as needed.

This setup gives institutions operational control without sacrificing automation or privacy.
