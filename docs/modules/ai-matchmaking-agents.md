# AI Matchmaking Agents

!!! note "Smarter Matches, Faster Deals"
    NexOTC uses AI Agents to connect buyers and sellers based on preferences, past behavior, trade size and compliance without compromising privacy.

## What Are AI Matchmaking Agents?

AI Matchmaking Agents are intelligent systems that help users find the right counterparty without manual searching. They work behind the scenes to:

- Review trade preferences like size, asset type and discount range;
- Cross-reference behavioral and historical activity;
- Guarantee that all matches meet verification status and jurisdiction requirements;
- Match users based on compatibility, not just price.

## How It Works

!!! abstract "1. Understanding Your Trade"
    Agents look at your inputs: asset type, discount range, tranche preferences, timelines, and more.

!!! abstract "2. Behavior & Trust Scoring"
    Based on past activity, responsiveness and completion rates, the system builds a trust profile that helps prioritize reliable matches.

!!! abstract "3. Finding the Right Fit"
    You're matched with counterparties who meet your parameters, share similar timelines and align on privacy or compliance preferences.

!!! abstract "4. Negotiation Support"
    Agents can propose **counter-offers** within your accepted range, helping both sides reach a faster agreement.

!!! abstract "5. Privacy Comes First"
    Your preferences and activity are never publicly exposed. All matchmaking runs on encrypted or zero-knowledge proofs so your privacy is always preserved.
