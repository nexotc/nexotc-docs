<h2>What is Multi-Layered Privacy?</h2>

At NexOTC, privacy isn‚Äôt a toggle ‚Äî it‚Äôs a stack. We offer **graduated privacy levels** to match both the **user‚Äôs preferences** and **regulatory needs**:

| Level     | Features                                                                 | Ideal For                           |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Low**   | zk-KYC, AML Check                                                        | Standard KYC users                  |
| **Medium**| Selective Disclosure                                                     | Professionals, brokers              |
| **High**  | Proxy Routing, Multi-Sig                                                 | Funds, DAOs, Family Offices         |

<h2>Key Privacy Components</h2>

=== "zk-KYC & AML Verification"

    Your identity and compliance status are securely verified without exposing any sensitive personal or institutional data.

      A[Wallet Connect] --> B[Submit KYC/KYB Info]
      B --> C[zk-SNARK Proof Generated]
      C --> D{AML Check Required?}
      D -- Yes --> E{Compliant or Flagged?}
      E -- Compliant --> F[‚úÖ DID Issued]
      E -- Flagged --> G[üö´ Manual Review / Trade Blocked]
      D -- No --> F
      F --> H[üîó KYC/AML Proof Linked to OTC Profile]

    style E stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5;
    ```

=== "Multi-Sig Wallet Setup"

    Multi-signature wallets provide shared control and added protection, making them a reliable choice for individuals, teams and institutions.

      B --> C[Link Multi-Sig Wallet to OTC Profile]
      C --> D[Sign OTC Trade Proposal]
      D --> E{Threshold Met?}
      E -- Yes --> F[‚úÖ Trade Authorized]
      E -- No --> G[üîí Waiting for More Signers]

    style E stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5;
    ```

=== "Proxy Wallet Setup & Routing"

    Trades are routed through one-time-use wallets to prevent address tracking, especially useful for counterparties requiring confidentiality.
    ```mermaid

      A[Generate Proxy Wallet] --> B[Link Proxy Wallet to Main Profile]
      B --> C[Fund Proxy Wallet]
      C --> D{Ready to Trade?}
      D -- Yes --> E[üîÄ Assets Routed via Proxy Wallet]
      E --> F[‚úÖ OTC Trade Executed]
      D -- No --> G[‚è≥ Wait or Cancel Setup]

    style D stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5;
    ```

<h2>Compliance First</h2>

All privacy settings are **auditable** using zk-Proofs and built with regulators in mind. Users must still complete mandatory KYC/KYB ‚Äî but can decide **what's visible to counterparties**.
