# Overview

!!! note "What are Overview Modules?"
    Modules are the core building blocks of NexOTC — each one handles a specific aspect of the OTC lifecycle, from trade initiation to compliance and final settlement.

<h2>✨ Key Highlights</h2>

- Modular by design: each component is decoupled and upgradeable.
- Built to support both individual and institutional OTC use cases.
- Enables seamless integration with smart contracts, wallets, KYC/AML systems, and more.

<h2>🔍 How It Works</h2>

At the heart of NexOTC lies a modular architecture. This allows the platform to remain:

- **Flexible** — plug-and-play different workflows or settings depending on the user profile (e.g., retail vs institution).
- **Compliant** — every module is aware of privacy and legal contexts.
- **Secure** — smart contracts and privacy layers isolate risks and automate enforcement.

Each module is designed to perform a specialized task and can work independently or as part of a larger flow.
