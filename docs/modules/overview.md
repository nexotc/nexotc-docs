# Overview

!!! note "What are Overview Modules?"
    Modules are the core components of NexOTC. Each one manages a specific part of the OTC process, from trade setup and execution to privacy, compliance and settlement.

## How It Works

NexOTC is built on a modular architecture that allows the platform to remain:

- **Flexible**: Easily adapt workflows and settings based on user type, whether individual or institutional;
- **Compliant**: Every module respects regulatory requirements and privacy standards by default;
- **Secure**: Smart contracts and privacy layers work together to isolate risk and enforce trade execution automatically.
