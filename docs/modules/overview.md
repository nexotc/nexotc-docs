# Overview

!!! note "What are Overview Modules?"
    Modules are the core building blocks of NexOTC. Each one handles a specific aspect of the OTC lifecycle, from trade initiation to compliance and final settlement.

## How It Works

At the heart of NexOTC lies a modular architecture. This allows the platform to remain:

- **Flexible** â€” plug-and-play different workflows or settings depending on the user profile (e.g. retail vs institutional);
- **Compliant** â€” every module is aware of privacy and legal contexts;
- **Secure** â€” smart contracts and privacy layers isolate risk and enforce trade rules automatically.
