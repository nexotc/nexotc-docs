# AI Matchmaking Agents

!!! note "Smarter Matches, Faster Deals"
    NexOTC uses AI-powered logic to match buyers and sellers based on preferences, trade history, volume, behavioral patterns, and compliance readiness — without compromising privacy.

<h2>🧠 What Are AI Matchmaking Agents?</h2>

AI Matchmaking Agents are autonomous algorithms that:

- Analyze submitted OTC parameters (trade size, asset type, discount range, etc.)
- Cross-reference behavioral and historical data
- Consider compliance flags (e.g. KYC status, risk profile)
- Match users based on compatibility, not just price

<h2>⚙️ How It Works</h2>

!!! info "1. Trade Preference Analysis"
    Agents parse your inputs: asset type, discount range, tranche preferences, timelines, and more.

!!! info "2. Behavior & Trust Scoring"
    We track on-chain behaviors (e.g., responsiveness, past trade success) to build a trust score.

!!! info "3. Counterparty Compatibility"
    We match you with counterparties who:
    - Meet your trade parameters
    - Have similar or compatible timelines
    - Align on compliance/privacy levels

!!! info "4. Negotiation Support"
    Agents can propose **counter-offers** within your set range, helping to finalize deals faster.

!!! info "5. Private, ZK-Powered Matching"
    All matching data remains **encrypted or ZK-proven**, ensuring your preferences and profile are never exposed.
