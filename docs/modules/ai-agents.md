# AI Matchmaking Agents

!!! note "Smarter Matches, Faster Deals"
    NexOTC uses AI Agents to connect buyers and sellers based on preferences, past behavior, trade size and compliance, without compromising privacy.

## What Are AI Matchmaking Agents?

AI Matchmaking Agents are intelligent systems that help users find the right counterparty, without manual searching. They work behind the scenes to:

- Review trade preferences like size, asset type, and discount range;
- Cross-reference behavioral and historical data;
- Evaluate compliance risk factors, such as jurisdiction, wallet history or past trade flags;
- Match users based on compatibility, not just price.

## How It Works

!!! info "1. Trade Preference Analysis"
    Agents parse your inputs: asset type, discount range, tranche preferences, timelines, and more.

!!! info "2. Behavior & Trust Scoring"
    We track on-chain behaviors (e.g., responsiveness, past trade success) to build a trust score.

!!! info "3. Counterparty Compatibility"
    We match you with counterparties who:
    - Meet your trade parameters
    - Have similar or compatible timelines
    - Align on compliance/privacy levels

!!! info "4. Negotiation Support"
    Agents can propose **counter-offers** within your set range, helping to finalize deals faster.

!!! info "5. Private, ZK-Powered Matching"
    All matching data remains **encrypted or ZK-proven**, ensuring your preferences and profile are never exposed.
