## Chain Support Strategy

NexOTC operates within the Ethereum ecosystem with full support for Ethereum Layer 1 and zkEVM-based Layer 2 networks.

We focus on chains where high-value OTC activity is already well-established, providing strong liquidity, regulatory alignment and interoperability with wallets and compliance tools.

### Supported Environments
- Ethereum Mainnet
- zkEVM Networks (e.g. Polygon zkEVM, Linea)

!!! tip "What is zkEVM?"
    zkEVM is a Layer 2 scaling solution that works directly on top of Ethereum. It uses zero-knowledge proofs to reduce gas fees and improve privacy while staying fully compatible with Ethereum smart contracts, tokens and wallets.

    NexOTC runs on zkEVM, meaning you’re still using Ethereum... just faster, cheaper and more secure.

💡 **Note:** Cross-chain support is not part of the initial roadmap. It may be explored later depending on market demand and security standards. For now, we’re focused on optimizing the Ethereum-native OTC experience.

## Asset Whitelisting

Only approved tokens can be traded on NexOTC. This keeps the platform safe and compliant when dealing with large or unfamiliar assets.
