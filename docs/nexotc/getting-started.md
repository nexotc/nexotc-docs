[^1]: 
    Onboarding is proceeded using zero-knowledge proofs which means your identity is confirmed without ever exposing your private data. After completing verification through a secure provider, you're issued a Decentralized Identifier (DID) and a Verifiable Credential (VC) (Example: Getting a digital passport that proves who you are without sharing sensitive info).

[^2]:
    After completing KYC / KYB, a zk-SNARK proof is then generated. Think of it like a cryptographic stamp that proves your identity has been verified, without revealing any personal details. This proof can be used across NexOTC to show you're a trusted party, whether you're trading once or a hundred times.
