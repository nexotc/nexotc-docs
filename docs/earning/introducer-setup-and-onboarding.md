# Introducer Setup & Onboarding

!!! note "Earn Commissions on OTC Deals"
    Introducers are wallets added to a specific OTC trade by a counterparty. Their commission is automatically routed when the trade is executed.

## What is an Introducer?

An introducer is someone who:

- Connects buyers and sellers off-chain;
- Represents a counterparty in the deal;
- Is eligible to receive a % of the trade.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Introducers are attached **per trade**, not at the platform level.

## How to Add Introducers

During the OTC deal setup process:

1. Navigate to the **Deal Parameters** section;
2. Choose "Add Introducers" under the commission settings;
3. Input up to 3 wallet addresses per counterparty;
4. Assign a commission % for each wallet (max 5% per counterparty);
5. Review and confirm introducer wallets and commission splits before the deal is signed.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Introducer wallets are screened for compliance to prevent payouts from being sent to restricted or sanctioned addresses.
