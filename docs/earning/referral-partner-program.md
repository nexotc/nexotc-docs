# Referral Partner Program

!!! note "Bring Users. Earn Rewards."
    The Referral Partner Program is built to reward contributors who bring new traders to NexOTC.

## How It Works

To join the Referral Partner Program, you must be a verified NexOTC user. Rewards are triggered only after your referred users successfully execute their first trade.

1. Generate a unique referral link tied to your wallet address;
2. Share it with your network, friends or community;
3. When referred users complete OTC trades, you earn a percentage based on platform fees;
4. Every allocation is on-chain with real-time tracking (dashboard).

## Referral Tiers

NexOTC uses a **fee-based referral model**, meaning rewards are calculated as a percentage of the platform fee generated by referred users' trades.
<br/><br/>
The more volume your network trades, the higher your share!

| Tier         | Criteria                                      | Share of Platform Fee  |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Bronze**   | Default Tier                                  | 10%                    |
| **Silver**   | $250K in referred trade volume                | 15%                    |
| **Gold**     | $1M+ in referred trade volume                 | 20%                    |
| **Platinum** | $5M+ in referred trade volume                 | 25%                    |

### Example

Letâ€™s say you refer a trader who executes a $5M OTC deal.

- NexOTC charges a 0.3% platform fee on that trade â†’ **$15,000**
- Youâ€™re in the **Gold Tier**, earning 20% of the platform fee
- Your referral payout = **20% of $15,000 = $3,000**

ðŸ’¡ If that same trader completes multiple deals, you continue to earn from each one with no limit and no expiration.

## Leaderboards

NexOTC highlights top contributors who help grow and activate the platform through direct OTC activity or network reach. All leaderboard data is tied to verified and private user profiles.
