# Revenue Share

!!! info "Own the upside of the network you help grow."
    NexOTC rewards active contributors with a direct share of platform revenue — from fees collected on every OTC deal executed.

---

<h2>🔁 How Revenue is Generated</h2>

Revenue comes primarily from:

- **Platform Fees** — flat percentage per OTC trade (e.g., 0.1%–0.5%)
- **Custom Desk Setups** — premium institutional services
- **Future Services** — SDK access, Escrow-as-a-Service, etc.

A portion of this revenue is distributed back to the community and token holders.
