# Legal & Jurisdiction

!!! info "Disclaimer"
    NexOTC is a **protocol and documentation project**, not a registered financial entity. Users are responsible for complying with local laws and regulations.

## Jurisdiction Strategy

NexOTC is created with a **jurisdiction-aware architecture**, allowing the platform to operate within regions where OTC trading is legally recognized for individuals and institutions.

We prioritize crypto-friendly jurisdictions known for regulatory clarity:

- 🇦🇪 **United Arab Emirates** — Leading global hub for Web3 and OTC infrastructure
- 🇸🇬 **Singapore** — Strong regulatory clarity and institutional adoption
- 🇨🇭 **Switzerland** — Advanced in tokenization and compliant asset management
- 🇭🇰 **Hong Kong** — Rapidly emerging as Asia's regulated OTC center
- 🇵🇹 **Portugal** — Friendly tax climate and growing European crypto base

## Regulatory Compliance Guidelines

Even as a non-custodial, NexOTC is built to align with global compliance standards:

- **KYC/KYB Verification**: Verified via zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to protect personal data;
- **AML Screening**: Wallet scoring, sanctions screening and transaction thresholds;
- **Audit-Friendly Trails**: All trades produce verifiable, zk-proof-based audit trails.
