# Legal & Jurisdiction

!!! info "Disclaimer"
    NexOTC is a protocol and documentation project — not a registered financial entity. Users are responsible for complying with local laws and regulations.

## 🌍 Jurisdiction Strategy

NexOTC follows a **jurisdiction-aware architecture**, ensuring that operations remain compliant in regions where over-the-counter (OTC) trades are legally permitted for both individuals and institutions.

Key jurisdiction focus:

- 🇸🇬 **Singapore** — Progressive stance on tokenized assets and institutional adoption

<h2>🧾 Regulatory Compliance Guidelines</h2>

While NexOTC is non-custodial and privacy-first, the platform aligns with global regulatory standards through:

- **KYC/KYB Verification** — via zero-knowledge proofs to respect data privacy
- **AML Screening** — wallet scoring, threshold triggers, and periodic checks
- **Audit-Friendly Trails** — verifiable transaction proofs and compliance logs

<h2>🛡️ Platform Responsibilities</h2>

- NexOTC does **not** custody assets or funds
- NexOTC does **not** facilitate public matching or market making
- All trades are initiated and approved **peer-to-peer**, requiring mutual consent

<h2>🧭 User Responsibilities</h2>
