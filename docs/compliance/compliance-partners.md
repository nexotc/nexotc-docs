# Partners & Integrations

!!! note "Why Compliance Integrations Matter"
    NexOTC is non-custodial and privacy-first — but also **regulatory-ready**. We work with top-tier compliance and identity providers to ensure seamless user verification, transaction tracing, and auditability without compromising user control.

<h2>🧬 Identity Verification (KYC/KYB)</h2>

NexOTC integrates **zero-knowledge identity protocols** that allow users to prove their verified status without disclosing sensitive information.

Current integration:
- ✅ **PrivadoID** – Privacy-preserving KYC/KYB using zk-SNARK proofs

<h2>🛂 Selective Disclosure & DID</h2>

We support **Decentralized Identity (DID)** systems to manage user credentials, verification states, and compliance preferences.

Current integration:
- ✅ **zkPass** – Selective disclosure layer enabling DID-compatible proofs

<h2>🔍 Wallet Risk Scoring & AML</h2>

We perform **real-time wallet screening** to detect flagged or high-risk activity across jurisdictions and blockchains.

Current integration:
- ✅ **Elliptic** – On-chain forensic tools for OFAC screening and AML compliance

<h2>📊 Compliance Reporting</h2>

Users and institutions can export:
- **ZK-based proof of compliance**
