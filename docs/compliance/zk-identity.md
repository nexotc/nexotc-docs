# ZK Identity

!!! note "Private by Design, Compliant by Default"
    NexOTC uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to verify identity and compliance without exposing personal data. You stay fully private while still meeting KYC/AML requirements.

## What is a ZK Identity?

A **ZK Identity** allows users to prove things like:

- “I’m KYC-verified”;
- “I’m an institutional account”;
- “I meet jurisdictional requirements”.

...without ever revealing the underlying details.

It’s enabled through:

- **zk-SNARKs**[^1] — mathematical proofs that confirm facts without showing data;
- **DIDs**[^2] — portable, reusable digital identity records;
- **Selective Disclosure** — reveal only what’s needed, when it’s needed.

## Benefits of ZK Identity

- 🔐 **No PII[^3] Exposure**: Your KYC/KYB data is never stored on-chain or visible to counterparties;
- ⚖️ **Selective Verification**: Proofs validate your identity, jurisdiction or role without showing the documents;
- 🌍 **Ready for Global Use**: Built for privacy standards in Europe, Asia, the US and more;
- 🔁 **Reusable & Portable**: Your identity can be reused across multiple trades or even integrated platforms.
